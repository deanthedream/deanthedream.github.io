	abstract = {In this work, we derive the exact response of an interferometric correlation radar to an arbitrary scene containing N independent point scatterers. The response of an interferometric radar to multiple targets can be complicated by the nonlinear processing, which generates intermodulation responses in addition to the desired fundamental frequency responses. An accurate signal model is critical for predicting and mitigating these intermodulation products and allows for model-based parameter estimation methods to be used to estimate target angular velocity. We derive a general response to an arbitrary number of independent targets and validate both the exact model and a simpler approximate model via simulation and experimental measurement with a 38-GHz continuous-wave interferometric radar. The experiment contains two targets traveling perpendicular to the radar's line-of-sight on linear stages at speeds of 0.36 and 0.5 m/s. We use an error metric to describe the similarity between the measured or simulated time-frequency response and the time-frequency response of a signal generated using the frequency estimates of either the exact or approximate models and show that in regimes where the small-angle approximation holds, both models provide an accurate representation of the measured or simulated interferometric response, demonstrating the feasibility of these models.},

@ARTICLE{ellision2021distributed,
	abbr = {IEEE TAP},
	author={Ellison, Sean M. and Merlo, Jason M. and Nanzer, Jeffrey A.},
	abstract = {We demonstrate a new approach to implementing directional modulation that leverages distributed array dynamics to change the antenna array pattern over time. With appreciable spacing between the elements, the spatial phase pattern varies rapidly, such that small physical motions result in large phase variations. We define an average radiation pattern that characterizes the space-time modulation of the array pattern and calculate a spatial information filter based on the additional modulation imparted on transmitted data. The concept is demonstrated experimentally using a two-element 1.5 GHz transmit array with relative motion between the elements. The array consists of two nodes, each with one dipole antennas transmitting BPSK data, and each with two log-periodic antennas used to estimate the relative separation of the nodes and correct the beamsteering phase of the transmitters. The node separation is varied dynamically over a range of $0.98\lambda$ – $4.7\lambda$. We investigate the use of linearly- and sinusoidally-varying internode dynamics, and demonstrate a low bit-error-ratio of approximately 10-5 at the desired transmission direction, indicating high throughput, and a high error ratio of approximately 10-0.3 at angles outside of the mainbeam, indicating corrupted data, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 12 dB.},

@article{merlo2021sar,
	abbr = {IEEE TVT},
	abstract = {Due to the rapid increase in 76 GHz automotive spectrum use in recent years, wireless interference is becoming a legitimate area of concern. However, the recent rise in interest of automated vehicles (AVs) has also spurred new growth and adoption of low frequency vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications in and around the 5.8 GHz unlicensed bands, opening the possibility for communications spectrum reuse in the form of joint radar-communications (JRC). In this work, we present a low frequency 5.9 GHz side-looking polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for automotive use, utilizing a ranging waveform in a common low frequency V2X communications band. A synthetic aperture technique is employed to address the angular resolution concerns commonly associated with radars at lower frequencies. Three side-looking fully polarimetric SAR images in various urban scenes are presented and discussed to highlight the unique opportunities for landmark inference afforded through measurement of co- and cross-polarized scattering.},

  @article{merlo2021dimensional,
  	abbr = {IEEE T-MTT},
  	abstract = {In this work, a method for directly measuring target velocity in three dimensions using a dual axis correlation interferometric radar is presented. Recent advances have shown that the measurement of a target's angular velocity is possible by correlating the signals measured at spatially diverse aperture locations. By utilizing multiple orthogonal baselines and using conventional Doppler velocity methods to obtain radial velocity, a full three-dimensional velocity vector can be obtained using only three receive antennas and a single transmitter, without the need for tracking. A 41.8 GHz dual axis interferometric radar with a 7.26λ antenna baseline is presented along with measurements of a target moving parallel to the plane of the radar array, and of a target moving with components of both radial and tangential velocity. These experiments achieved total velocity root-mean-square errors of 41.01 mm/s (10.5%) for a target moving along a plane parallel to the array, and 45.07 mm/s (13.5%) for a target moving with components of radial and tangential motion relative to the array; estimated trajectory angle RMSEs of 10.42° and 5.11° were achieved for each experiment respectively.},

  abstract = {We present a novel technique for directly estimating the angular velocities of multiple targets using multi-baseline millimeter-wave interferometric radar to significantly reduce nonlinear signal distortion caused when multiple targets are present. We show that through the multiplication of the normalized instantaneous frequency measurements across different baselines, nonlinear intermodulation products resulting from dual-antenna interferometric angular velocity measurements can be mitigated, producing only the terms corresponding to the angular velocity of the targets in the scene. To validate this, simulations were performed demonstrating the close agreement between the proposed method and an ideal correlation (without intermodulation distortion). Near-field errors resulting from far-field approximations are analyzed. Finally, experimental results of a three-antenna, three-baseline 38 GHz interferometric radar are presented that demonstrate the recovery of the motion of two oscillating pendulums of differing angular frequencies.},
