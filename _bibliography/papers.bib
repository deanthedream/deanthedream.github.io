abstract = {We present target selection and scheduling algorithms for missions with direct imaging of exoplanets, and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) in particular, which will be equipped with a coronagraphic instrument (CGI). Optimal scheduling of CGI targets can maximize the expected value of directly imaged exoplanets (completeness). Using target completeness as a reward metric and integration time plus overhead time as a cost metric, we can maximize the sum completeness for a mission with a fixed duration. We optimize over these metrics to create a list of target stars using a greedy optimization algorithm based off altruistic yield optimization (AYO) under ideal conditions. We simulate full missions using EXOSIMS by observing targets in this list for their predetermined integration times. In this poster, we report the theoretical maximum sum completeness, mean number of detected exoplanets from Monte Carlo simulations, and the ideal expected value of the simulated missions.},

abstract = {Future, large-scale, exoplanet direct-imaging missions will be capable of discovering and characterizing Earth-like exoplanets and star systems like our solar system. However, a telescope capable of detecting Earth-like exoplanets would also be sensitive to a myriad of non-Earth-like exoplanets in the exoplanet population with the same instantaneous planet–star separation (s) and planet–star difference in magnitude ($\Delta$mag). Here, we consider the solar system as a previously unexplored exosystem, viewed by an external direct-imaging observer for the first time. We find that an external observer could see as many as six (s, $\Delta$mag)-coincidence locations between the Earth and other solar system planets. We determine locations of (s, $\Delta$mag)-coincidence of solar system planets using realistic planet phase functions and planet properties. By varying system inclinations, we found 36{\%}–69{\%} of inner planet orbits and 1{\%}–4{\%} of outer planet orbits share at least one (s, $\Delta$mag)-coincidence with the Earth.},

abstract = {An exoplanet direct imaging mission using an external occulter for starlight suppression could potentially achieve higher contrasts and throughputs than an equivalently sized telescope with an internal coronagraph. We consider a formation flying mission where the starshade must station-keep with a telescope, assumed to be on a halo orbit about the Sun-Earth L2 point, during observations and slew between observations as the telescope re-orients to target the next star. We use a parameterization of the slew fuel cost calculation based on interpolation of exact solutions of boundary value problem in the circular restricted three body formalism. Time constraints are imposed based on when stars are observable due to the motion of bright sources in the solar system, integration times, and mission lifetime constraints. Finally, we present a comprehensive cost function incorporating star completeness values as a reward heuristic and retargeting fuel costs to sequentially select the next best star to observe. Ensembles of simulations are conducted for different selection schemes; for a 3 year mission, taking two steps of the linear cost function produces the most unique detections with an average of 7.08{\&}plusmn; 2.55.},

abstract = {The coronagraphic instrument (CGI) on the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will likely provide our earliest opportunity to directly image and spectrally characterize the reflected light from sub-Jovian, extrasolar planets. The CGI will serve as an important technology demonstrator for future space coronagraphs, and is likely to produce highly valuable science products in its own right, so it is extremely important to develop an observing program to fully demonstrate its capabilities. One approach to maximizing the probability of imaging exoplanets with the CGI is to preferentially target systems with known exoplanets that were discovered by indirect means from the ground or other space missions. Unfortunately, of the nearly 4000 confirmed exoplanets, fewer than 100 are likely to be observable by the WFIRST CGI, due to the inherently opposing biases on planet period between indirect methods and imaging. Furthermore, the orbits of these known planets are only partially constrained, and their photometric characteristics are typically entirely unknown. Here, we describe methods for selecting the most likely known target systems for CGI imaging and for estimating the probabilities of planet detection in each case. We couple the partially constrained orbital solutions from the literature with statistical models of unknown orbital parameters and photometric model grids to evaluate distributions of potential planet angular separations and relative fluxes at varying observing times. Finally, we present and discuss the top current known planet candidates for CGI imaging and how this list is likely to evolve with new discoveries.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 SPIE. Space observatories have many advantages over ground-based telescopes. However, constructing and launching large space telescopes remains a significant challenge. A solution to this problem lies in autonomous, in-space assembly. To gain benefits from efficiencies of scale and mass production, a modular telescope assembled in space can be constructed from identical mirror segments. These identical segments must then be deformed to an appropriate shape in space. This work examines the optical feasibility of such a project, using a 31 meter Ritchey-Chr{\'{e}}tien telescope composed of about 1,000 1-m mirrors as a case study. In particular, this work examines the shape of the telescope optics through Zernike decomposition and computes the physical optics propagation of such a system to analyze the resultant PSF with simulation in Zemax OpticStudio.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. Future large-scale exoplanet direct-imaging missions will be capable of discovering and confirming Earth-Like exoplanets. The community has traditionally used the fraction of planets occurring within the visible limits of a telescope to evaluate these telescope designs. However, using only the instrument's geometric constraints and assuming a limiting planet magnitude ignores integration time requirements and can lead to overly optimistic performance predictions. In this paper, we present a new method for evaluating the fraction of observable planets that accounts for integration time. We also provide analytical methods for calculating the planet-star separation extrema for any given planet and analytical methods describing the true anomaly values at which a planet has a given planet-star separation. This new completeness calculation method explains some of the differences in the HabEx final report between EXOSIMS exoplanet yield numbers and completeness based yield estimates and attributes them to the lacking capabilities of current completeness based telescope performance evaluations. Our methods demonstrate that traditional completeness methods used in the final report and other exoplanet yield estimates overestimate yield between 32{\%} and 141{\%} compared to integration time adjusted completeness depending on the instrument capabilities and target.},
