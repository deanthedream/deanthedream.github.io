I am a Senior Engineer of the Science Analysis and Modeling Section at the Applied Physics Laboratory.
I work on software for automated spacecraft command scheduling.
My research interests lie in the optimization of spacecraft design. My particular interest is how spacecraft operation and mission success criteria impact mission performance.

Previously, I received a Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University with a specialization in Operations Research, a masters of science in Aerospace Engineering from Cornell, a masters of engineering from Cornell, and a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering From Michigan Technological University.

In addition to studying optimization, I enjoy woodworking, coding, mountain biking, kayaking, and miscellaneious art projects.
