I am a Senior Engineer in the Science Analysis and Modeling Section of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
I work on software for automated spacecraft command scheduling.
My research interests lie in the optimization of spacecraft design and operations.
My particular interest is how spacecraft operation and mission success criteria impact mission performance.

Previously, I received a Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Cornell University with a specialization in Operations Research.
My thesis was on the "Evaluation and Scheduling of Exoplanet Direct Imaging Missions" in the Space Imaging and Optical Sciences Laboratory.
I also received a masters of science in Aerospace Engineering and a masters of engineering from Cornell and my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering was from Michigan Technological University.

In addition to studying optimization of space engineering challenges, I enjoy woodworking, coding, boardgames, mountain biking, kayaking, and miscellaneious art projects.
