I am a Senior Engineer in the Science Analysis and Modeling Section of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
I work on software for automated spacecraft command scheduling.
My research interests lie in the optimization of spacecraft design. My particular interest is how spacecraft operation and mission success criteria impact mission performance.

Previously, I received a Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Cornell University with a specialization in Operations Research as well as a masters of science in Aerospace Engineering and a masters of engineering.
I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Michigan Technological University.

In addition to studying optimization of space engineering challenges, I enjoy woodworking, coding, boardgames, mountain biking, kayaking, and miscellaneious art projects.
